# STAT461

### Setting up / running Jupyter notebooks

You have essentially two choices to use these notebooks:
 
1. Follow the instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install.html) to install Jupyter on your computer. You will also need to 
install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and the [R kernel](https://cran.r-project.org/package=IRkernel) for Jupyter. See full instructions
[here](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/).

2. Run these notebooks on the [syzygy](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/) server. There are Julia, Python 2, Python 3, and R kernels available (although we will only use the R one). Sign in with your UBC CWL. Once you are logged in, use [this link](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/msalibian/STAT461-2023) to clone this GitHub repository (STAT461-2023) directly onto your [syzygy](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/) home directory.
